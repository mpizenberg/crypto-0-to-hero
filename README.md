# crypto-0-to-hero

This repo contains the code for the "crypto 0 to hero" Twitter series.

This code is implemented using the Roc language because it is
pure functional and fully typed while staying very readable and pragmatic.
So this sounds like a perfect language for learning content.

To run one of the examples, install the Roc compiler (https://www.roc-lang.org/install), and then simply run `roc test` followed by the example you are interested in.

```sh
# run all tests for the 02-caesar.roc example
roc test 02-caesar.roc
```
